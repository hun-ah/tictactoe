## How It's Made:
**Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

This tic tac toe game was made completely from scratch - meaning that I didn't reference any tutorials or use any tips online on how to create the game. 
This is a big step for me in my programming journey, as it shows I have the knowledge and skill to build my own programs. This is not to say that the
program is done in the most efficient way possible (because it isn't) and there is a lot of room for imorovement and refactoring down the line.

I knew this program would have a lot of moving parts, so I started out by writing pseudo code for each piece of the program that I thought I would
need, including displaying an X or O on the screen, switching players, checking for a win or a tie, updating the score etc. I knew I would need some
click events and created those accordingly. 

I really wanted to try and program this game with OOP in mind. I created a class of Player and a constructor function that would allow me to create both
a Player 1 and Player 2 object, that shared a displayMarker method. I found this to be very helpful when I was trying to change the colour of the O to be 
pink and have a pink text shadow on it, as all I had to do was pass in a few arguments. I decided to change the colour of the O at the end of the project 
and I found that I only had to add a couple bits of code and knew that I wouldn't be breaking something else in my program by making these changes. 

I tried my best to keep each piece of behaviour in a single function. I feel like this kept the code looking quite organized and clean. I really realized
in this project how having local variables comes in handy and being able to reuse the same variable name in different functions, without running the risk
of reassignment, is very important to keeping good code.

Keeping my HTML as organized as possible was a goal for this project. Practicing this helped me to better understand parent child relationships between 
elements and how to better organize my HTML to set myself up for success with the CSS. 

When it came to the CSS, my goal was to better understand flexbox and how parent/child/sibling relationships work (inheritance).
Out of all of my projects so far, this one has the most organized and ideal layout (nothing is spilling out of its container, everything has its own 
container, there is less random addition of margins/padding because I didn't lay things out correctly).

Overall, I am very pleased with the product, despite some of its flaws!
